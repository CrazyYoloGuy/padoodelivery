- Track which resources are accessed and modified
- Record detailed action metadata and context

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security Events**
- Automatic detection of brute force attempts
- Alert on logins from new/suspicious locations
- Monitor for account lockouts and security violations
- Severity-based event classification

### üîç **Dashboard Integration**

- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Export logs to CSV for external analysis
- Read-only access to prevent tampering

## Installation

### 1. Run the SQL Setup

Execute the `enhanced_admin_logging.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of enhanced_admin_logging.sql
-- into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it
```

### 2. Tables Created

The system creates these tables:

- **`admin_login_logs`** - Login attempts and authentication events
- **`admin_session_logs`** - Session activity tracking
- **`admin_activity_logs`** - Dashboard actions and resource access
- **`admin_security_events`** - Security incidents and alerts

### 3. Functions Available

- `log_admin_login_attempt()` - Records login attempts
- `log_session_activity()` - Tracks session events
- `log_admin_activity()` - Logs admin actions
- `get_admin_dashboard_stats()` - Provides dashboard statistics

## Data Retention

### Default Retention
- **Login Logs** - 90 days
- **Session Logs** - 90 days  
- **Activity Logs** - 90 days
- **Security Events** - Indefinite (for unresolved events)

### Maintenance
Run the cleanup function to remove old logs:

```sql
-- Clean logs older than 90 days (default)
SELECT * FROM cleanup_old_logs();

-- Clean logs older than 30 days
SELECT * FROM cleanup_old_logs(30);
```

## Sample Data

The system includes sample log entries for testing:
- Successful logins from different browsers and locations
- Failed login attempts with various reasons
- Different IP addresses and user agents
- Recent timestamps for realistic testing

## Troubleshooting

### No Logs Showing
1. Check if Supabase is properly configured
2. Verify the SQL setup completed successfully
3. Ensure you have the correct credentials
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Location Not Showing
- Location lookup requires internet access
- Some IP addresses (local/private) show as "Local Network"
- Geographic data depends on IP geolocation services

### Export Not Working
- Check browser popup blockers
- Verify you have sufficient logs to export
- Ensure modern browser with blob support

## API Integration

### Logging Functions

To integrate with your existing authentication system:

```sql
-- Log a login attempt
SELECT log_admin_login_attempt(
    'Admin1234',                    -- username
    'password_attempt',             -- password (for security analysis)
    '192.168.1.100'::inet,         -- IP address
    'Mozilla/5.0...',               -- user agent
    true,                           -- success (true/false)
    NULL,                           -- failure reason (if failed)
    'user-uuid-here',               -- admin user ID
    'session-token-here'            -- session token
);

-- Log session activity
SELECT log_session_activity(
    'user-uuid-here',               -- admin user ID
    'session-token-here',           -- session token
    'create',                       -- action (create/refresh/expire/logout)
    '192.168.1.100'::inet,         -- IP address
    'Mozilla/5.0...',               -- user agent
    60                              -- duration in minutes (for logout)
);

-- Log admin activity
SELECT log_admin_activity(
    'user-uuid-here',               -- admin user ID
    'Admin1234',                    -- username
    'view_logs',                    -- action performed
    'logs',                         -- resource type
    NULL,                           -- resource ID
    '{"filters": "today"}',         -- additional details (JSON)
    '192.168.1.100'::inet,         -- IP address
    'Mozilla/5.0...'                -- user agent
);
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring** - Check logs daily for suspicious activities
2. **Retention Policy** - Implement appropriate data retention
3. **Access Control** - Limit who can view logs
4. **Export Backup** - Regularly export logs for external storage
5. **Alert Response** - Investigate security events promptly

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify Supabase configuration and connectivity
3. Ensure all SQL functions were created successfully
4. Test with sample data first
5. Check network connectivity for location services
